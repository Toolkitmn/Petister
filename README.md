Retro Fantasy Computer Interface

This new Project is inspired by the old Interface of a REtro Computer Fantasy Monochrome Screen, it have not much in common in the mechanics or coding no BASIC no Assembly but HTML and Java.
It was written by me with help of chat gpt to correct some bugs of the games found on a HTML Book or to build some Games. You can add your own Game by adding another HTML file with the coding of the 
new Game and a button in HTML coding inside the interface index.html file linking it to the html file of the new Game saved in the PETister folder in C:/. Respect the Black and Green Screen line to 
maintain that retro style. This project was built in 2025.

IDEA: It is possible to build a retro style Computer with this interface a PC with a retro case, windows or linux etc. by adding at startup a browser linked to the local page of this Project; index.html.
