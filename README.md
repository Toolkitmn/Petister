# Petister
Retro Fantasy Computer Interface
This new project is inspired by the old interface of the Commodore Basic in PET Computer Screen, it have not much in common in the mechanics or coding no BASIC no Assembly but HTML and Java.
It was written by me with help of chat gpt to correct some bugs of the games found on a html book or build some games. You can add your own game by adding another html file and a button in the
interface index.html linking it to the html file saved in the PETister folder in C:/. Respect the Black and Green Screen line to maintain that retro style.
This project was built in 2025 and has nothing with Commodore other that the word written in the interface in html.
